//useless piece of code, like the rest of the file, but i don't know if i can delete it yet, ts is just an array why the hell do we need a class for that. I'm writting this helped by copilot
//seriously, this is a class for an array, like, what the hell. Who in the world would do that. I mean, I know who, but like, why? It's just an array.
//This is so stupid, I just don't get it. When I see this, I just want to cry. I mean, I know it's not my code.
//This make me sad. I don't know why, but it does. I just want to cry. 
//Well , I guess I have to deal with it. I mean, it's not like I can change it. It's just there.
//I guess I have to live with it. It's just a part of life. I guess I have to accept it.
//Maybe one day, I will understand why this is here. Maybe one day, I will understand why this is a class.
//Maybe one day, I will understand why this is a class for an array. 
//But for now, I just have to deal with it. 
//Why does shit like this exist? Why do I have to deal with this?
//I'm not paid enough for this.
//Anyway, let's get back to work :(
